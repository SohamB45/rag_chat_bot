This may be due to your Sending IP, or the message content. Since these are message-specific issues, future messages to these addresses are not suppressed.\n\nBounces - The recipient's email server rejects the message, or sends the message back to SendGrid, due to an issue with the recipient address.\n\nInvalid Emails - The recipient address does not exist at the mail server you sent to.\n\nSpam Reports - The recipient marks your email as spam.\n\nGlobal Unsubscribes - When a user unsubscribes from everything you might email them.\n\nGroup Unsubscribes - When a user unsubscribes from a specific group of your emails."

    "Response/ Resolution": "IP Access Management is a security feature that allows you to control who can access your SendGrid account based on their IP address. After you allow an IP address, you can only access the SendGrid UI, API, and SMTP relay if you are connecting from an allowed IP address. Any access attempts from other IPs will be blocked. This is a powerful security tool that you can use to help prevent malicious activity on your account.\n\nNOTE: It is possible to remove your own IP address from your list of allowed addresses, thus blocking your own access to your account.\n\nEnable IP Access Management\nThere is no limit on the number of IP addresses you can allow.\n\nTo enable IP Access Management and add allowed addresses\n\n1. Navigate to the Settings > IP Access Management in the Twilio SendGrid App.\n2. You will see a message explaining IP Access Management under Allow Listed IP Addresses until you enable IP Access Management. IP Access Management will be enabled once you add one or more allowed IPs.\n3. Under Recent Access Attempts, you will see a list of IPs that recently attempted to connect to your account, regardless of whether or not they are allowed addresses. You will also see some additional information about those IPs, such as the date of the first and most recent access attempt, the physical location of the IP, and the method by which they attempted to access your account.\n\ni. Click Add IP Addresses.\nii. A dialog will appear. Check the two radio boxes to acknowledge that you understand this feature and select Confirm and Continue.\niii. The Add IP Addresses menu will appear showing Your Current IP and a list of the Recently Accessed IPs.\niv. You can add recently accessed IPs by clicking the + next to the IP you wish to allow.\nv. You can add all the listed recent addresses by clicking Add all to form below.\nvi. Any added IPs will appear in the table labeled IP addresses or ranges to add.\nvii. You can enter a single IP address or range of IP addresses that don't appear in your recently accessed list by clicking Manually add IPs.\nviii. A field labeled IP addresses or ranges to add: will appear.\nix. Add your desired IP or range of IPs in CIDR notation. See the \"Add a range of IP addresses\" section of this page for more about CIDR notation and working with ranges. Separate individual IPs and ranges using either a comma, space, or new line.\nx. Once you have added all your desired IP addresses, click Add <number> IPs at the bottom of the menu.\nxi. You will be returned to the Add IP Addresses menu. Your manually added IPs will now appear in the table labeled IP addresses or ranges to add.\nxii. Your IPs are now staged to be added. Click Save to finalize adding the addresses to your list of allowed IPs.\n\nNote: If you do not add your current IP address, you will be prompted to add it. Choosing not to add your current IP will terminate your session. You will then have to reconnect to your account from one of your allowed addresses.\n\n4. Remove an allowed IP\nFrom the Settings > IP Access Management page, navigate to the Allow Listed IP Addresses list.\nClick the action menu to the right of the allowed address you want to remove and select Remove From Allow List.\n\n5.
